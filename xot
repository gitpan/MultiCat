# As you can see, comments can go just about anywhere,
# the lines don't have to be very neat, and
# text doesn't have to start at the beginning of a line.
# The first line need not be the first line of the file.
# When you run the module, it makes 1.html, 2.html, and 3.html.
# Each .html file is built by concatenating the ealier files
# mentioned on its line, in the order mentioned.
# Comments, obviously, start with the sharp character,
# just as they do in most 'nix configuration files.
# You've read the README file already, right?
